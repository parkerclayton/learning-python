type: jupyter notebook to open whatever that is
I installed what I think is the python IDE, but not sure. 
also installed PIP, and home-brew “use brew help in terminal”
created an account in github. have yet to post, or run through 'hello world'
working on a tutorial at www.swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/

trying to uninstall jupyter notebook so i can use anaconda which has a local notebook.
anaconda and jupiter are IDE’s that use python (I think)

———————————————————————————
was able to uninstall jupiter notebook successfully
to start using python, type ipython
other useful callouts: brew, condo
turns out brew and condo are both package management systems (they do the same thing)
python is the “text editor” or IDE

———————————————

turns out python has a text editor… but it sucks.
I downloaded pycharm.. a real IDE for python. 
I also imported the matplotlib package, and the bumpy package and am working through the sw carpentry tutorial, putting it in a script titled “sw carpentry tutorial”.
the tutorial is here http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/01-numpy.html
